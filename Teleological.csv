1,The Teleoloogical argument,"The universe shows evidence of design, therefore someone must have designed it",,
2,Biology shows design,There is some evidence of design in the intricasy of biological organisms,1,S
3,Origin of life,The origin of life is still completely unnown to science,2,S
4,Evolution,"Life seems to be able to design itself, as “good” life forms are more likely to survive.",2,R
5,No comparison,"There is only one universe we know of, so there is no other universe to compare the complexity to (so how can we call the universe *complex*).",15,R
6,Weak proof,"The universe is finite, so it isn't a like effect for an infinite God",1,R
7,Imperfect,"The universe is imperfect, therefore God is also imperfect (perfection can only cause more perfection)",6,S
8,Many Gods,Many Imperfect Gods could create a universe by combining forces,7,R
9,Discovery,We have discovered many new things about the universe,1,S
10,Complexity increase,"These new discoveries have increased the complexity of the nown universe, thus giving more evidence of design",9,S
11,No need for God,"The new discoveries explain some of the universe's mysteries without need of a God, sosurely the universe is explainable through these discoveries",9,R
12,Multiverses,"There is no reason to discount the possibility of universes with different physics, that we don't know about.",14,R
13,Illusion of design,We could be seeing design and/or purpose when there actually is none. e.g: A lightning strike can be seen as a work of art.,1,R
14,Physics,"There is only one set of laws of physics, and they seem perfect for planets like Earth to form.",1,S
15,Induction,"All complex things we have checked for a designer have had one, the world is complex, so it is probable that the world has a designer.",1,S
16,Carbon,"Carbon's chemical properties (specifically, it's ability to form complex molecules) is vital to life, and yet unique on the periodic table, potentially hinting at design?",3,R
