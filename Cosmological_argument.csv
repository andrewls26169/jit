1,Cosmological argument,"The universe needs a first cause, therefore God exists as said first cause.",,
2,Could not exist,"Hypothetically, the universe could not exist, therefore there must be an explaination as to why it exists.",1,S
3,I think therefore I am,"I know the universe must exist, otherwise I can't be part of it, therefore it isn't “hypothetically possible” for there to be no universe.",2,R
4,Before the big bang,"As the big bang is the start of time itself, to ask what caused it would be like asking “what's north of north?” (as such a cause would be before the biginning of time.",1,R
5,What caused God,"If everything needs a cause, surely God would also need a cause himself. ",1,R
6,Dependance,All beings are either dependant (have a cause) or independent (no cause). Therefore all beings are dependant OR there is at least one independent being. Not all beings are dependant; therefore there must be an independent being (God).,1,S
7,explaination required,"If all beings are dependant, there must be an explaination for the infinite regression of dependant beings. It also cannot be a part of the chain of dependant beings, so it must be independent",6,S
8,Causal loops,"If a being travels back in time, it could be able to cause it's own existance, meaning the “infinite regression” could actually be finite.",7,R
9,Not ontological,"The cosmological argument only shows thet there must be an ontological argument to prove God's existence, but said argument isn't showing up anywhere!",1,R
10,A step too far?,"An indepenant being does NOT necessarily have to be an omnipotent creator, he/she/it only has to be both immortal and powerful enough to generate a universe; which isn't quite omnipotence as the universe is NOT infinite in size or time (in theory).",6,R
11,Not shown isn't nonexistant,"Just because the ontological argument we are looking for isn't showing up, doesn't mean it doesn't exist at all. ",9,R
