1,Anslem's Chapter 2 argument,"If one thinks of a being where nothing greater could be imagined (an omnipotent God): then – as something that is real is greater than the same thing in the imagination (real food has more calories than imaginary food) – we can be certain that such a being must exist because, if God doesn't exist, then the person has imagined something that is greater than the thing where nothing greater could be imagined; a contradiction of the first statement.",,
2,The fool's comparison,"If one claims that it is impossible to think of a being of which nothing greater can exist, they are, in that statement, referring to a being of which nothing greater can exist, and therefore thinking of him/her for the purpose of comparison and thus contradicting themselves!",3,S
3,Implies thought is possible,"The argument could also have the contradiction resolved by stating that the being of which nothing greater can be imagined can't actually be imagined. This makes the argument only prove we can't comprehent an omnipotent being, a fact we know as an omnipotent being is able to do things beyond the brain's comprehension (if it can't, it isn't omnipotent!), and is therefore incomprehensible.",1,R
4,Existing doesn't imply greatness,"The argument has a premise that something real is greater than something imaginary, BUT there are some cases where the imaginary version is the greater one, for example: a real mistake is worse than an imaginary one; and one could prefer psycology over biology (such as myself). Therefore something real isn't always greater than it's imaginary counterpart, so it could also apply to Gods (most atheists would prefer a nonexistant God over one that actually exists).",1,R
5,Comparison implies others,"By saying there is something greater than God, we are comparing",,
