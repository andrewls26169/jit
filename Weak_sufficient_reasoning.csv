1,The weak sufficient reason version,"1) It is impossible to destroy an omnipotent being, 2) If a being doesn't exist, there can be an explaination for why. 3) assume God doesn't exist 4) There can be an explaination for God not existing (from 2 and 3) 5) There cannot be an explaination for God not existing, as that would destroy him. 6) 4 contradicts 5, 7) Thus, assumption 3 is clearly faulty.",0,S
2,Omnipotent=invincible,"Our conception of God is an omnipotent being. Because an omnipotent being is un-surpassable, it cannot be defeated, therefore, such a being cannot be destroyed by any means.",7,S
3,A probematic inference,"Premise 1 implies that nothing can destroy a God that already exists, however reasoning step 5 assumes premise 1 means nothing can prevent a God that doesn't already exist from existing (by disproving it through an apriori argument such as the problem of evil). Therefore reasoning step 5 is out of context.",1,R
4,A non-contradiction?,"Reasoning step 5 states that it is not actually possible for there to be an explaination for God's non-existence, but reasoning step 4 only states that it is hypothetically possible for such an explaination for God's non-existence. This means they do not directly clash as contradiction 6. For an example of this non-contradiction: it is hypothetically possible for me to create a perpetual motion machine, but it is not actually possibe as it would violate the law of conservation of matter and energy.",1,R
5,Unintended contradiction,"Conclusion 7 is an explaination for God to exist, but it is logically impossibe for a non-omnipotent being to create an omnipotent being (as such an omnipotent being would be immortal and thus infinite in time scince creation (citation:Boltzmann brains)). Therefore if 5 can be inferred from 1, then 7 being false can also be inferred from 1, as God having an explaination for existing would be created by the argument!",1,R
6,Premise 2 holds water,"The idea that everything can (note this isn't must) have an explaination, called the weak principle of sufficient reason, is shown to be true through induction (everything we have encountered has been exlained, so it is probable that everthing we will encounter can be explained), and the idea of causation (a cause is a type of explaination, and everything is shown to have a cause). Also: the idea of everything being explainable fits well with the scientific method. ",7,S
7,The premises work,Both premises are shown to be accurate,1,S
