1,The omniscience-immutability argument (map),"God knows all, and believes truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He also is completely unchangable. However there are some facts, like “It is now 15:31” that go out of date. These so-called A-propositions (really? What does the A stand for?). It is thus impossible for an unchangable being (one who's knowledge does not change) to know one of these A-propositions as to know such a thing would require the change of knowledge. Therefore: an immutable God cannot be omniscient.",,
2,Conceptually possible?,"The idea that it is impossible for an immutable being to know a changing fact is a premise (and an extremely bold claim at that), and therefore needs an explaination.",1,R
3,There is an explaination,"For every A-proposition, there is a time at which it is true, and a time at which it is false. This infers that a being that does not change cannot know the A-proposition at both times; as it knowing it at the first time and not later changing would force it to not know the A-proposition at the second time.",2,R
4,Knowledge of time can be indirect.,"God could know that time changes facts. It could then constantly listen to a changing “time-bound knower” (who isn't immutable) and believe all A-propositions the time-bound knower states (this doesn't require the God to change itself, only the time-bound knower needs to change.",1,R
5,Another problem,"If God relies on a time bound knower to be omniscient, that meants that for both time and God to exist, there must also be time-bound knowers. This implies that God is entirely depenant on non-immutable (and thus mortal) time-bound knowers. Beause time will never stop, God will “die” the instant time-bound knowers go extinct. This makes God mortal, which bluntly contradicts both omnipotence and immutability.",4,R
6,limited knowledge,"God is still limited by the bounds of basic logic, so if it is logically impossible for God to know something (such as a changing fact), he can't actually know it despite his “omniscience”...",1,R
7,Obvious cop-out," This is an obvious cop-out and the “omniscient” being who's knowledge is limietd by logic is – well – limited, and thus non-omniscient.",6,R
