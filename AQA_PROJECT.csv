1,God existing,"This argument map will explore the arguments for and against the idea of God existing. There may seem like proof both ways, but often  it ends up a disappointing fake out. Overall, my conclusion is that there is no definitive proof either way, so the jury's out on my concluson. Although Anslem's chapter 2 argument is very clever and, the best one, it is not enough to give definitive proof. \n \n Also: the data visualisation (hyperbolic trees) isn't actually my work and was used as it had a creative commons lisence and surpasses my expectations. Nicolas Garcia Belmonte (the creator of hyperbolic trees) is in no way responsible for any loss or damage caused by  hyperbolic trees and any works derived from them, like this one!",,
2,Religious experiences,"In almost all cultures, there has been some record of interaction with divine beings. There have been many unrelated accounts on the subject of an all-powerful, non-human, ultimate metaphysical being.",1,S
3,Disturbingly similar,"Accounts on this being are remarkably similar to each-other. To a reasonable degree, of course. These supernatural beings could be the same God, as they are so similar.",2,S
4,"Same brain, same problems","Because all humans have remarkably similar psychology, we all will see the same hallucinations and patterns. This means we would all see similar illusions of a God.",3,R
5,All a hoax?,"There is reason to believe that we are biased to believe mysterious things must be God, or aliens, or something else unexplainable. Also: when something on the edge of the realm of physics does come up; it gets a lot of press, so everyone is baised to see what is abnormal over  the rational.",1,R
6,Religious experiences aren't empirical evidence?!?,"For religious experiences to count as cognitive experiences, they need to be proven as sensory experiences. I don't follow how this logic is ever going to lead to dis-proof of all religious experiences being sensory in all ways, but I'm putting it in anyway because apparently it's a legitimate rebuttal.",2,R
7,Pascal's wager,"The argument follows as so. You can believe in God, or not. God can exist, or not. If you believe in God and he exists, you gain unlimited goodness from heaven. If you don't believe and he exists, you get unlimited problems in hell. If you believe and he doesn't exist, there may be some nasty “holy wars” and science runs the rick of being taboo, but the huge damage is only finite. If you don't belive and he doesn't exist, you gain in the form of peace and scientific advancement. This is a huge but finite gain. If there is even the tiniest chance of God existing, tiny x infinity > huge x huge. Therefore, we should believe.",1,S
8,Maybe not,"Surely a just God would value someone who honestly and carefully thinks things through, instead of jumping to conclusions or doing things soley for the reward, even if the person comes out with the wrong answer. This God is, if anything, just as likely to exist as the God who only saves believers. The chance of this God existing x infinity is also infinity, so Pascals wager  actually doesn't ake everything into account.",7,R
9,Finite losses,"The probablility of God existing is pretty much 0, so the infinite gain and loss can be treated as obscure. This means it would be better if everyone didn't believe, as that would meant no holy wars, and much, much more awesome science. This finite gain is better than nothing.",7,R
10,"Is religion good, though","Religion does have the advantage of binding communities together. (hence why it evolved was evolved to be ingrained in the human species in the first place) Surely it is a good thing to keep religion, or at least tradition, in society for its benefits.",9,R
11,Morality,"Assume God does NOT exist. Should we believe in him anyway? Religion has the benefit of binding communities together, hence why tribes with religion were more successful than those without. This could mean that, regardless of if God exists or not, we should believe in him. This makes the question of 'does God actually exist' rather pointless. The answer should be assumed “Yes” even if the truth says otherwise.",1,S
12,Binds and splits,"Although religion can bind communities together, if there is more than one: it can cause wars, extremism, discrimination, and other things that split communities/cause violence (citation: ISIS). This causes some reason not to believe in God, so non-belief can be justified. Also: Science is often limited by religion, even though it is good for society. We may need to sacrifice religion so science can advance society into the next centuries.",11,R
13,More reasons to believe,"Not only does religion bind communities together, but it also forces people to follow rules that instate charity and equality, such as Galatians 3:28. This would force society to become more organised and less likely to discriminate. This increases the chances of technology being developed and lives being saved. Bear in mind that trying to remove religion froma society, like in China, can be extremely controversial and can cause violent protest. This could make a lack of reigion more costly than any benefits a society may gain from growing out of religion.",11,S
14,The weak sufficient reason version,"1) It is impossible to destroy an omnipotent being, 2) If a being doesn't exist, there can be an explaination for why. 3) assume God doesn't exist 4) There can be an explaination for God not existing (from 2 and 3) 5) There cannot be an explaination for God not existing, as that would destroy him. 6) 4 contradicts 5, 7) Thus, assumption 3 is clearly faulty.",1,S
15,Omnipotent=invincible,"Our conception of God is an omnipotent being. Because an omnipotent being is un-surpassable, it cannot be defeated, therefore, such a being cannot be destroyed by any means.",20,S
16,A probematic inference,"Premise 1 implies that nothing can destroy a God that already exists, however reasoning step 5 assumes premise 1 means nothing can prevent a God that doesn't already exist from existing (by disproving it through an apriori argument such as the problem of evil). Therefore reasoning step 5 is out of context.",14,R
17,A non-contradiction?,"Reasoning step 5 states that it is not actually possible for there to be an explaination for God's non-existence, but reasoning step 4 only states that it is hypothetically possible for such an explaination for God's non-existence. This means they do not directly clash as contradiction 6. For an example of this non-contradiction: it is hypothetically possible for me to create a perpetual motion machine, but it is not actually possibe as it would violate the law of conservation of matter and energy.",14,R
18,Unintended contradiction,"Conclusion 7 is an explaination for God to exist, but it is logically impossibe for a non-omnipotent being to create an omnipotent being (as such an omnipotent being would be immortal and thus infinite in time scince creation (citation:Boltzmann brains)). Therefore if 5 can be inferred from 1, then 7 being false can also be inferred from 1, as God having an explaination for existing would be created by the argument!",14,R
19,Premise 2 holds water,"The idea that everything can (note this isn't must) have an explaination, called the weak principle of sufficient reason, is shown to be true through induction (everything we have encountered has been exlained, so it is probable that everthing we will encounter can be explained), and the idea of causation (a cause is a type of explaination, and everything is shown to have a cause). Also: the idea of everything being explainable fits well with the scientific method. ",20,S
20,The premises work,Both premises are shown to be accurate,14,S
21,The omniscience-immutability argument (map),"God knows all, and believes truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He also is completely unchangable. However there are some facts, like “It is now 15:31” that go out of date. These so-called A-propositions (really? What does the A stand for?). It is thus impossible for an unchangable being (one who's knowledge does not change) to know one of these A-propositions as to know such a thing would require the change of knowledge. Therefore: an immutable God cannot be omniscient.",1,R
22,Conceptually possible?,"The idea that it is impossible for an immutable being to know a changing fact is a premise (and an extremely bold claim at that), and therefore needs an explaination.",21,R
23,There is an explaination,"For every A-proposition, there is a time at which it is true, and a time at which it is false. This infers that a being that does not change cannot know the A-proposition at both times; as it knowing it at the first time and not later changing would force it to not know the A-proposition at the second time.",22,R
24,Knowledge of time can be indirect.,"God could know that time changes facts. It could then constantly listen to a changing “time-bound knower” (who isn't immutable) and believe all A-propositions the time-bound knower states (this doesn't require the God to change itself, only the time-bound knower needs to change.",21,R
25,Another problem,"If God relies on a time bound knower to be omniscient, that meants that for both time and God to exist, there must also be time-bound knowers. This implies that God is entirely depenant on non-immutable (and thus mortal) time-bound knowers. Beause time will never stop, God will “die” the instant time-bound knowers go extinct. This makes God mortal, which bluntly contradicts both omnipotence and immutability.",24,R
26,limited knowledge,"God is still limited by the bounds of basic logic, so if it is logically impossible for God to know something (such as a changing fact), he can't actually know it despite his “omniscience”...",21,R
27,Obvious cop-out," This is an obvious cop-out and the “omniscient” being who's knowledge is limietd by logic is – well – limited, and thus non-omniscient.",26,R
28,Omnipotence vs evil,"If an omnipotent, benevolent God existed, it would want to end evil and be able to end evil... BUT evil exists so God either can't stop it (not omnipotent) or doesn't want to (not benevolent)",1,R
29,Free will defence,"It can be said that eings with free will cause all evil, and to take away free will would be a greater evil.",28,R
30,Omniscience (foresight) vs freedom,"If God is omniscient, he can foresee everything that will happen (except British weather; that can NEVER be foreseen!) including what I will do; however I have free will and can decide my own actions without relation to the visions (so I could do something literally unpredictable). Also: if God tells himself, or me what happens next and he/I changes the future, that change is not foreseen and therefore true foresight (and thus omniscience) is impossible.",1,R
31,Determinalism,The premise that the future is not predetermined and I have free will is not necessarily true (it's just a lack of it is extremely disturbing if one thinks about it for too long),30,R
32,Immutability vs time,"God is supposedly immutable and omniscient, but the facts of the universe are constantly changing so a truly omniscient being would also need to change over time to keep its knowledge correct (implying up-to-date)",1,R
33,Omnipotence vs control,"All things either can or can't be done by any partiular being, and an omnipotent God can do all of these things. If a being can't set it's own limits, it isn't omnipotent because that is a thing it can't do. If it can set it's own limits, however, it can't surpass said limits later and is therefore still not omnipotent. Therefore omnipotence is impossible.",1,R
34,Omnipotence vs foresight,"If God is omnipotent, he is able to prevent any future he foresees; BUT if he is omniscient, the future he sees is always correct and thus immutable. This is a clear contratiction from the lone premise that God is omnipotent (if one can do anything, it has to know how to do everything, and therefore must know everything, i.e: omniscience)",4,S
35,Sovereignty vs benevolence ,"If God is able to decide what is right and wrong (which is asserted by most (not all) monotheistic religions); and he is benevolent,then he must always do the right thing... Even before he decides what that “right thing” is. This means he is forced into following uncreated rules (which makes no sense whatsoever!)",30,R
36,“logically impossible”,"God is still limited by the bounds of basic logic, so if it is logically impossible for God to do something (such as set his own limits), he can't actually do it despite his “omnipotence”... This is an obvious cop-out and the “omnipotent” being that is limited by logic is – well – limited, and thus non-omnipotent.",33,R
37,Creation vs immutability argument,"1) The world came into existence at a time (Big Bang) (premise) 2) The universe only exists because God willed it to (assumption for proof by contradiction) 3) God never changes (another assumption for proof by contradiction) 4) At Big Bang: God willed the universe into existence. (from 1 and 2) 5) There is a time before the big bang (Big Bang -1) where the universe didn't exist (from 1) 6) At Big Bang -1, God doesn't will the universe into existence (from 2 and 5) 7) God had a property at one time but not at another; therefore he/she is not immutable. This contradicts 3, therefore, God is impossible.",1,R
38,No time,"Before the big bang (which is a contradictory statement), time did not exist, therefore 5 cannot be inferred from 1.",37,R
39,Doesn't matter,"There is a variation of the argument that stated that at t1 an object does not exist (God isn't willing it to) but at t2 it does (God DOES will it to exist), and it follows the same logic but only with that one object, not the whole universe. This version does not require reasoning step 5 at all.",38,R
40,We lack knowledge,"The comparison 7 doesn't hold water because it requires that we compare God and time. A comparison requires knowledge of both the things we are comparing (according to Augustine), but quantum physicists can't get a grip on how time works and some religions, such as Islam, state that we don't know how God works, either.",37,R
41,God's time is unlike ours,"Because God is immortal, his/her perception of time would, according to Augustine, is  that God percieves all time at once (which makes sense for an omniscient being; so he wills the universe to 'exist from Big Bang to End', NOT 'exist' from Big Bang to End. This means that although the objects change, God doesn't; he just sets objects to stop and start existing at specific times and doesn't directly change them afterwards.",40,S
42,Disappearence of time argument,"In our perception of time: the present has a duration of 0. Also, all beings that exist are in the present. However, because the present has no duration – and thus has a time-volume (or whatever you're supposed to call it) of 0m³s, it can't fit any objects that have volume and duration (i.e. anything that actually exists!) inside it. Therefore; unless our perception of time is flawed: nothing can exist, contradicting “I think therefore I am”. Therefore: our perception of time is flawed.",40,S
43,Planck time,"According to quantum physics, the present DOES have a duration, if only of a single planck (the planck distance and time can be inferred as similar to frames and pixels in a video), meaning the present has some time-volume, therefore we have a perception of time that isn't impossibe and thus we can claim knowledge of time",42,R
44,The Teleoloogical argument,"The universe shows evidence of design, therefore someone must have designed it",1,S
45,Biology shows design,There is some evidence of design in the intricasy of biological organisms,44,S
46,Origin of life,The origin of life is still completely unnown to science,45,S
47,Evolution,"Life seems to be able to design itself, as “good” life forms are more likely to survive.",45,R
48,No comparison,"There is only one universe we know of, so there is no other universe to compare the complexity to (so how can we call the universe *complex*).",58,R
49,Weak proof,"The universe is finite, so it isn't a like effect for an infinite God",44,R
50,Imperfect,"The universe is imperfect, therefore God is also imperfect (perfection can only cause more perfection)",49,S
51,Many Gods,Many Imperfect Gods could create a universe by combining forces,50,R
52,Discovery,We have discovered many new things about the universe,44,S
53,Complexity increase,"These new discoveries have increased the complexity of the nown universe, thus giving more evidence of design",52,S
54,No need for God,"The new discoveries explain some of the universe's mysteries without need of a God, sosurely the universe is explainable through these discoveries",52,R
55,Multiverses,"There is no reason to discount the possibility of universes with different physics, that we don't know about.",57,R
56,Illusion of design,We could be seeing design and/or purpose when there actually is none. e.g: A lightning strike can be seen as a work of art.,44,R
57,Physics,"There is only one set of laws of physics, and they seem perfect for planets like Earth to form.",44,S
58,Induction,"All complex things we have checked for a designer have had one, the world is complex, so it is probable that the world has a designer.",44,S
59,Carbon,"Carbon's chemical properties (specifically, it's ability to form complex molecules) is vital to life, and yet unique on the periodic table, potentially hinting at design?",46,R
60,Cosmological argument,"The universe needs a first cause, therefore God exists as said first cause.",1,S
61,Could not exist,"Hypothetically, the universe could not exist, therefore there must be an explaination as to why it exists.",60,S
62,I think therefore I am,"I know the universe must exist, otherwise I can't be part of it, therefore it isn't “hypothetically possible” for there to be no universe.",61,R
63,Before the big bang,"As the big bang is the start of time itself, to ask what caused it would be like asking “what's north of north?” (as such a cause would be before the biginning of time.",60,R
64,What caused God,"If everything needs a cause, surely God would also need a cause himself. ",60,R
65,Dependance,All beings are either dependant (have a cause) or independent (no cause). Therefore all beings are dependant OR there is at least one independent being. Not all beings are dependant therefore there must be an independent being (God).,60,S
66,explaination required,"If all beings are dependant, there must be an explaination for the infinite regression of dependant beings. It also cannot be a part of the chain of dependant beings, so it must be independent",65,S
67,Causal loops,"If a being travels back in time, it could be able to cause it's own existance, meaning the “infinite regression” could actually be finite.",66,R
68,Not ontological,"The cosmological argument only shows thet there must be an ontological argument to prove God's existence, but said argument isn't showing up anywhere!",60,R
69,A step too far?,"An indepenant being does NOT necessarily have to be an omnipotent creator, he/she/it only has to be both immortal and powerful enough to generate a universe; which isn't quite omnipotence as the universe is NOT infinite in size or time (in theory).",65,R
70,Not shown isn't nonexistant,"Just because the ontological argument we are looking for isn't showing up, doesn't mean it doesn't exist at all. ",68,R
71,Occam's razor,"This is the idea that if a complex and a simple idea will both suffice, we should assume the simple one to be true. It implies that if there is NO proof or significant evidence either way, we should assume God doesn't exist.",1,R
