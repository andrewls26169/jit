1,The omniscience-immutability argument (map),"God knows all, and believes truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He also is completely unchangable. However there are some facts, like “It is now 15:31” that go out of date. These so-called A-propositions (really? What does the A stand for?). It is thus impossible for an unchangable being (one who's knowledge does not change) to know one of these A-propositions as to know such a thing would require the change of knowledge. Therefore: an immutable God cannot be omniscient.",2,R
2,Conceptually possible?,"This is a premise (and an extremely bold claim at that), and therefore needs an explaination.",1,R
