1,A-postriori reasoning,"There is some evidence, and other arguments from experience to suggest God's existence. ",,
2,Religious experiences,"In almost all cultures, there has been some record of interaction with divine beings. There have been many unrelated accounts on the subject of an all-powerful, non-human, ultimate metaphysical being.",1,S
3,Disturbingly similar,"Accounts on this being are remarkably similar to each-other. To a reasonable degree, of course. These supernatural beings could be the same God, as they are so similar.",2,S
4,"Same brain, same problems","Because all humans have remarkably similar psychology, we all will see the same hallucinations and patterns. This means we would all see similar illusions of a God.",3,R
5,All a hoax?,"There is reason to believe that we are biased to believe mysterious things must be God, or aliens, or something else unexplainable. Also: when something on the edge of the realm of physics does come up; it gets a lot of press, so everyone is baised to see what is abnormal over  the rational.",1,R
6,Religious experiences aren't empirical evidence?!?,"For religious experiences to count as cognitive experiences, they need to be proven as sensory experiences. I don't follow how this logic is ever going to lead to dis-proof of all religious experiences being sensory in all ways, but I'm putting it in anyway because apparently it's a legitimate rebuttal.",2,R
7,Pascal's wager,"The argument follows as so. You can believe in God, or not. God can exist, or not. If you believe in God and he exists, you gain unlimited goodness from heaven. If you don't believe and he exists, you get unlimited problems in hell. If you believe and he doesn't exist, there may be some nasty “holy wars” and science runs the rick of being taboo, but the huge damage is only finite. If you don't belive and he doesn't exist, you gain in the form of peace and scientific advancement. This is a huge but finite gain. If there is even the tiniest chance of God existing, tiny x infinity > huge x huge. Therefore, we should believe.",1,S
8,Maybe not,"Surely a just God would value someone who honestly and carefully thinks things through, instead of jumping to conclusions or doing things soley for the reward, even if the person comes out with the wrong answer. This God is, if anything, just as likely to exist as the God who only saves believers. The chance of this God existing x infinity is also infinity, so Pascals wager  actually doesn't ake everything into account.",7,R
9,Finite losses,"The probablility of God existing is pretty much 0, so the infinire gain and loss can be treated as obscure. This means it would be better if everyone didn't believe, as that would meant no holy wars, and much, much more awesome science. This finite gain is better than nothing.",7,R
10,"Is religion good, though","Religion does have the advantage of binding communities together. (hence why it evolved was evolved to be ingrained in the human species in the first place) Surely it is a good thing to keep religion, or at least tradition, in society for its benefits.",9,R
