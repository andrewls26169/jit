1,The nature of God,This argument map contains some small extra arguments that show God's existance to be contradictory.,,
2,Omnipotence vs evil,"If an omnipotent, benevolent God existed, it would want to end evil and be able to end evil... BUT evil exists so God probably doesn't.",1,S
3,Free will defence,"It can be said that eings with free will cause all evil, and to take away free will would be a greater evil.",2,R
4,Omniscience (foresight) vs freedom,"If God is omniscient, he can foresee everything that will happen (except British weather; that can NEVER be foreseen!) including what I will do; however I have free will and can decide my own actions without relation to the visions (so I could do something literally unpredictable). Also: if God tells himself, or me what happens next and he/I changes the future, that change is not foreseen and therefore true foresight (and thus omniscience) is impossible.",1,S
5,Determinalism,The premise that the future is not predetermined and I have free will is not necessarily true (it's just extremely disturbing if one thinks about it for too long),4,R
6,Immutability vs time,"God is supposedly immutable and omniscient, but the facts of the universe are constantly changing so a truly omniscient being would also need to change over time to keep its knowledge correct (implying up-to-date)",1,S
7,Omnipotence vs control,"All things either can or can't be done by any partiular being, and an omnipotent God can do all of these things. If a being can't set it's own limits, it isn't omnipotent because that is a thing it can't do. If it can set it's own limits, however, it can't surpass said limits later and is therefore still not omnipotent. Therefore omnipotence is impossible.",1,S
